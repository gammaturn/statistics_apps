# Statistics apps
Collection of webapps as supplementary material for the lecture course
"Biostatistics", which I teach at the University of Graz. 
The apps were created using [Dash](https://dash.plot.ly/).

To run it locally:
```
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python wsgi.py
```
